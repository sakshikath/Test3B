## Project Overview
This project is a Pizza Ordering System created using JavaFX. It was initially attempted on Visual Studio Code with JavaFX SDK, but due to runtime display issues, it was shifted to Replit, an online IDE. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage pizza orders and perform basic operations.
Assistance for GUI development, bill calculation, simulated data, and CRUD operations was provided by ChatGPT.

## Sections Completed
**Section A**
Created a Main.java file to launch the JavaFX application using Replit.
**Section B**
Designed the GUI scene for pizza ordering. Files created in this section:
* PizzaOrderPage.java
* PizzaOrder.java
* BillCalculator.java
**Section C**
As Replit does not support an actual database connection, a file named SampleData.java was created to simulate data for the TableView.
**Section D**
Implemented the bill calculation logic inside the BillCalculator.java file based on pizza size and quantity.
**Section G**
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality was implemented. Orders can be created, selected, updated, and deleted through the interface.
**Section H**
All project files were pushed to GitHub and a README file was created.

## Tools Used
* JavaFX
* Replit IDE
* Git and GitHub

## Run Information
1. Open the Replit project.
2. Run the Main.java file.
3. The GUI will open through a VNC interface.
4. Use the buttons to create and manage pizza orders.

## Acknowledgement
Chatgpt is used for sampledatabase.java for Section E and F file as sql database connector is not supported by replit.
